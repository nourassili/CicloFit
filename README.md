🌀 CicloFit
Train with your cycle. Run stronger, every phase.
CicloFit is a fitness and running app designed specifically for women, helping them adapt their training to the phases of their menstrual cycle. Because your body isn’t the same every day — and your training shouldn’t be either.

🚀 Why CicloFit?
Most training plans ignore menstrual cycles — but hormones impact energy, recovery, and performance. CicloFit helps you:

🔁 Sync your workouts with your hormonal phases

🏃‍♀️ Maximize performance during high-energy phases

🧘‍♀️ Prioritize rest or light activity when recovery matters most

📈 Track patterns in performance, mood, and motivation over time

🩸 How It Works

Get personalized guidance: Your training plan adjusts based on which phase you're in (menstrual, follicular, ovulatory, luteal).

Run smart: Receive phase-specific training suggestions, nutrition tips, and reminders.

Track trends: See how syncing your workouts improves your performance over time.

🌙 Who It’s For
Women who run — from beginners to marathoners — and want to train in sync with their body instead of fighting against it.

✨ Vision
CicloFit isn't just an app — it's a movement to reframe how we think about women’s performance. We're building a future where female athletes don’t have to “push through” their bodies — they can partner with them.
